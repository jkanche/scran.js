/* This file defines a utility class to:
 * 
 * - Create a buffer allocation in the Wasm heap upon construction.
 * - Spawn a TypedArray view to fill it with content on the JS side.
 * - Pass the pointer offset to Wasm to do various calculations.
 * - Optionally respawn the TypedArray view to get the output.
 * - Free the allocation by calling delete().
 *
 * It seems safest to (re)construct the TypedArray view immediately before use,
 * and certainly after any allocations have occurred on the Wasm heap. This is
 * because any allocations may cause the heap to move, thus invalidating all
 * existing TypedArray views bound to previous memory locations.
